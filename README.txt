# My name is Ricardo Z√°rate

## I'm a highly motivated business professional with a passion for data analytics and a deep-rooted commitment to helping businesses make informed decisions. 

I graduated Cum Laude with a degree in Business Administration, focusing in Business Analytics. I have experience with a wide range of data analysis tools 
and programming languages, including SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Excel, IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding, and Microsoft Azure Video Indexer. 

In my previous role as an Application and Program Analyst, I had the privilege of working on various impactful projects. I was responsible for crafting budget proposals, 
extracting meaningful insights from consumer data at a Fortune 100 social technology company, and supporting Salesforce Cloud and SAP implementations. Additionally, 
I played a vital role in creating polished PowerPoint deliverables to drive business initiatives forward. My ultimate goal is to continue assisting businesses in 
leveraging the power of data to tackle complex client problems, drive growth, and make strategic decisions. Feel free to connect with me!
